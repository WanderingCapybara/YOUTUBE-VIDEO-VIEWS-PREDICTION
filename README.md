# Youtube Video Views Prediction


## Background

This project's primary objective was to develop a robust machine-learning model capable of accurately predicting the view count of YouTube videos based on a range of crucial features, including metrics like likes, dislikes, comments, and channel characteristics.

From the perspective of a content creator, the outcomes of this project carry substantial weight. They promise to offer invaluable insights into the intricate dynamics that contribute to a video's popularity. These insights extend beyond merely identifying positive influencers; they also shed light on factors that might potentially hinder a video's performance. Armed with this knowledge, content creators have a powerful tool at their disposal to fine-tune their content strategies and make data-driven decisions to amplify their video output.
