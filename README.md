# Youtube Video Views Prediction

## Project Background

This project holds significant importance among the various endeavors I undertook during my participation in a data science bootcamp. Its primary objective was to develop a robust machine learning model capable of accurately predicting the view count of YouTube videos based on a range of crucial features, including metrics like likes, dislikes, comments, and channel characteristics.

From the perspective of a content creator, the outcomes of this project carry substantial weight. They promise to offer invaluable insights into the intricate dynamics that contribute to a video's popularity. These insights extend beyond merely identifying positive influencers; they also shed light on factors that might potentially hinder a video's performance. Armed with this knowledge, content creators have a powerful tool at their disposal to fine-tune their content strategies and make data-driven decisions to amplify their video output.

## Libraries

Here are the versions of the libraries that I used:

- pandas 1.2.1
- numpy 1.26.0
- matplotlib 3.7.0
- matplotlib-inline 0.1.6
- seaborn 0.12.2
- scikit-learn 0.24.1
- xgboost 1.7.6
- optuna 3.3.0
- shap 0.42.1


## Result and Conclusion

This machine learning project has provided valuable insights into the factors that influence the popularity and engagement of YouTube videos. Leveraging advanced algorithms and SHAP values interpretation, the project has uncovered the key drivers behind video success on the platform.

It was found that user engagement metrics, such as likes and dislikes, play a pivotal role in increasing video popularity. Additionally, factors like the time it takes for a video to trend, video category, and video title length have shown significant impacts on the predicted outcomes.

Furthermore, the project has shed light on less impactful or even detrimental factors, such as lengthy video descriptions, weekend publishing, and certain video categories. These insights will empower content creators and platform administrators to make informed decisions and optimize content creation and publishing strategies.

Moving forward, the knowledge gained from this project will serve as a solid foundation for refining content strategies, enhancing user engagement, and making data-driven decisions to improve the platform's performance and impact. Machine learning has proven to be a powerful tool in unlocking these insights, and its application promises continued success in the future.
